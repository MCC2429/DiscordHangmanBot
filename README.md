# DiscordHangmanBot
A hangman bot capable of running one server at a time


This bot is currently under testing and only capable of running on one Discord server at a time.  It is bare boned but functional and useable.  The text-based representation of "The Gallows" does not work properly on mobile as some of the "empty" characters used to create it are only properly recognized on a PC.

In the future, plans for the hangman bot include multi-server capabilities, server win/loss tracking, full word guessing, and user statistics for correct guesses, total guesses, and winning guesses.

A .env file is required to run with the bot profile's token for authorization.
